        Your job is still converting but you can start annotating now. Return to

        There are currently {{ num_annotations }} annotated slices.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can train a model with any number of annotated slices, but you won't
        get any interesting results with fewer than 5, and we recommend at least
        50. (You can always annotate a more and retrain!)

            not yet want to generate segmentation</i>, you can click to <a href="#" id="train-only-trigger-button"
