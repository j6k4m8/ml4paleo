        There are currently {{ num_annotations }} annotated slices.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can train a model with any number of annotated slices, but we recommend at least 10. (You
        can always annotate a bit more and then retrain!)

        If you would like to refresh the realtime segmentation that you're shown in the annotation tool but you <i>do
            not yet want to generate segmentation</i>, you can click to <a href="#" id="train-only-trigger-button"
            onclick="triggerTrainOnly()">retrain
            the model</a>.
